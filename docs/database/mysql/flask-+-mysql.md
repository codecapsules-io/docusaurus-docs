# Flask + MySQL

Deploy a Flask MySQL application and learn how to host backend code on Code Capsules.

## Setup

Code Capsules connects to GitHub repositories to deploy applications. To follow this guide, you'll need a [Code Capsules](https://codecapsules.io/) account and a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

To demonstrate how to deploy a Flask MySQL application with Code Capsules, we've provided an example application, which you can find on the [Code Capsules GitHub repository](https://github.com/codecapsules-io/demo-flask-mysql).

Sign in to GitHub, and fork the example application by clicking **Fork** at the top-right of your screen and selecting your GitHub account as the destination.

## Create the Capsules

A [Capsule](/platform/capsules/what-is-a-capsule) provides the server for hosting an application on Code Capsules.

Navigate to the Spaces tab and open the Space you'll be using.

Click the yellow **+** button in the bottom left of the screen, select **New Capsule**, and follow the instructions below to create a Data Capsule:

1. Choose **Data Capsule**.
2. Under **Data Type**, select **MySQL Database Cluster**.
3. Under **Product**, select **Standard**.
4. Click **Create Capsule**.

Navigate to the **Space** containing your recently created Data Capsule and click the **New Capsule** button. Follow the instructions below to create a Backend Capsule:

1. Choose **Backend Capsule**.
2. Under **Product**, select **Sandbox**.
3. Choose the GitHub repository you forked.
4. Press **Next**.
5. Leave **Run Command** blank.
6. Click **Create Capsule**.

Code Capsules will automatically build your application when you've finished creating the Capsule. While the build is in progress, you can view the log by clicking **View Build Progress** next to the **Building Capsule** message.

Once your application is live, you can view the build log by selecting the **Deploy** tab and clicking the **View build log** link in the **Builds** section.

## Connect the Capsules

After the two capsules have been successfully built, the next step is to connect them. To do this, navigate to the **Config** tab of your Backend Capsule. Scroll down to the **Data Capsule** section and click **View** to view the environment variables from the Data Capsule. Click the `+` next to the `Connection string` variable to create a `DATABASE_URL` environmental variable in your Backend Capsule, which gives access to services and features of your Data Capsule.

## Edit `DATABASE_URL` Environment Variable

Once the binding is complete, you have to append `+pymysql` after `mysql` in the `DATABASE_URL` value under the **Capsule parameters** section on the **Configure** tab.

Confirm your changes by clicking on **Update Capsule** then restart your capsule by toggling the radio button in the top right off and on again.

## View Application

After restarting the capsule, the application will now be ready to be viewed. Click the **Live Website** link at the top of the capsule tab, and you should see your deployed application.
